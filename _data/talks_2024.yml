        title: "Taking a turn for the better: Conversation redirection throughout the course of mental-health therapy"
        speaker: "Vivian Nguyen & Dave Jung"
        affiliation: "Cornell University"
        abstract: "Mental-health therapy involves a complex conversation flow in which patients and therapists continuously negotiate what should be talked about next. For example, therapists might try to shift the conversation's direction to keep the therapeutic process on track and avoid stagnation, or patients might push the discussion towards issues they want to focus on. How do such patient and therapist redirections relate to the development and quality of their relationship? To answer this question, we introduce a probabilistic measure of the extent to which a certain utterance immediately redirects the flow of the conversation, accounting for both the intention and the actual realization of such a change. We apply this new measure to characterize the development of patient-therapist relationships over multiple sessions in a very large, widely-used online therapy platform. Our analysis reveals that (1) patient control of the conversation's direction generally increases relative to that of the therapist as their relationship progresses; and (2) patients who have less control in the first few sessions are significantly more likely to eventually express dissatisfaction with their therapist and terminate the relationship."

        speaker: "Nivedita Bijlani"
        affiliation: "University of Surrey"
        abstract: "Sensor-based remote health monitoring for people living with dementia in their home enables the early detection of adverse health events, reducing the risk of hospitalisation. However, real-world home sensor data present challenges such as noise, sparse and imprecise labelling, inter-household variability, and the need for clinical explainability. To address these challenges, we developed a lightweight, explainable AI pipeline for anomaly detection in home sensor data, aimed at facilitating early health event detection. Validated in an ongoing real-world dementia monitoring study, the pipeline employs a self-supervised contrastive learning model to generate noise-resilient daily representations, compute anomaly scores, and trigger alerts based on household-personalised thresholds. Novel 'spatiotemporal attention maps' provide insights into the source and timing of anomalies, offering clinicians interpretable insights into atypical behaviour patterns. Additionally, LLM-powered anomaly summaries enhance clinical interpretability. Validation on a 90-patient cohort (40,866 person-days; May 2022 - Feb 2024) demonstrated high sensitivity and generalisability. The system was developed for the Minder Research Study, launched in August 2019 by the UK Dementia Research Institute Care Research and Technology Centre at Imperial College London, in partnership with the University of Surrey, and Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Trust."

      title: "Detecting Bipolar Disorder from Misdiagnosed Major Depressive Disorder with Mood-Aware Multi-Task Learning"
      speaker: "Dr Daeun Lee"
      affiliation: "Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul"
      abstract: "Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a mental disorder characterized by intense mood swings, from depression to manic states. Individuals with BD are at a higher risk of suicide, but BD is often misdiagnosed as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) due to shared symptoms, resulting in delays in appropriate treatment and increased suicide risk. While early intervention based on social media data has been explored to uncover latent BD risk, little attention has been paid to detecting BD from those misdiagnosed as MDD. Therefore, this study presents a novel approach for identifying BD risk in individuals initially misdiagnosed with MDD. A unique dataset, BD-Risk, is introduced, incorporating mental disorder types and BD mood levels verified by two clinical experts. The proposed multi-task learning for predicting BD risk and BD mood level outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. Also, the proposed dynamic mood-aware attention can provide insights into the impact of BD mood on future risk, potentially aiding interventions for at-risk individuals."

      speaker: "Kubra Cengiz"
      affiliation: "Istanbul Technical University"
      abstract: "Atypical neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can result in changes to cortical morphology at different levels, influencing brain structure and connectivity. In this talk, I will introduce a novel approach using multi-view cortical morphological networks (CMNs), derived from T1-weighted MRI, to study and fingerprint the brain's cortical morphology in ASD compared to neurotypical individuals. This research explores cortical morphology on three levels: individual regions, pairwise region relationships, and multi-view relationships across different cortical attributes such as cortical thickness. Using tensor component analysis, we identify the most representative morphological connectivities shared across CMN views for both the ASD and neurotypical populations. Our findings highlight how specific brain regions, including the temporal, frontal, and insular lobes, are structurally different in ASD individuals, and how these differences correspond to clinical features observed in patients."

      speaker: "Dr. Angus Addlesee"
      affiliation: "Amazon Alexa"
      abstract: "We deployed an LLM-based spoken dialogue system in a hospital for over a year. Using generative AI and the ARI robot, real patients and their companions had conversations with our system while waiting for their next appointment. They asked for directions, asked about the cafe menu, asked for jokes, played quizzes, and enjoyed some light distraction from their otherwise stressful day. This multi-party setting in the hospital memory clinic is extremely challenging, requiring computer vision, speech understanding, and gesture generation (arm, head, and eye movements).\n\nIn this talk, Angus will describe this complex setting and the architecture of the dialogue system. Our system decides when it should take its turn, generates human-like clarification requests when the patient pauses mid-utterance (to improve accessibility for people with dementia), answers in-domain questions (grounding to the in-prompt knowledge), and responds appropriately to out-of-domain requests (like generating jokes or quizzes). This latter feature is particularly remarkable, as real patients often utter unexpected sentences that could not be handled previously."

      title: "Charting Therapeutic Alliances Turn-by-Turn via Language Modeling"
      speaker: "Dr. Baihan Lin"
      affiliation: "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"
      abstract: "The therapeutic working alliance is a critical factor in predicting the success of psychotherapy treatment. Traditionally, working alliance assessment relies on questionnaires completed by both therapists and patients. In this talk, we present COMPASS, a novel framework to directly infer the therapeutic working alliance from the natural language used in psychotherapy sessions. Our approach utilizes advanced large language models (LLMs) to analyze transcripts of psychotherapy sessions and compare them with distributed representations of statements in the working alliance inventory. Analyzing a dataset of over 950 sessions covering diverse psychiatric conditions including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and suicidal tendencies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in providing fine-grained mapping of patient-therapist alignment trajectories and offering interpretability for clinical psychiatry and in identifying emerging patterns related to the condition being treated. By employing various deep learning-based topic modeling techniques in combination with prompting generative language models, we analyze the topical characteristics of different psychiatric conditions and their evolution at a turn-level resolution. This combined framework enhances the understanding of therapeutic interactions, enabling timely feedback for therapists regarding the quality of therapeutic relationships and providing interpretable insights to improve the effectiveness of psychotherapy. This talk will also explore pathways for collaboration, particularly in scaling these solutions and applying them to broader health challenges, offering insights into how AI can bridge the gap between data and effective mental health interventions."

      speaker: "Harsh Kumar"
      affiliation: "University of Toronto"
      abstract: "Engagement is a critical, though not sufficient, component for the success of digital mental health interventions. In this talk, I will explore how adaptive bandit experiments, leveraging algorithms like Thompson Sampling, can be utilized to investigate and enhance user engagement in digital mental health (DMH) interventions. These algorithms can offer the potential for continuous personalization and ensure robust data collection for social-behavioral analysis. Building on this, I will discuss the emerging role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in providing scalable social support within DMH interventions. Our recent randomized experiments found that LLM agents, especially those designed to offer information with a friendly persona, significantly boosted user engagement in mindfulness exercises. Finally, I will discuss ongoing work at the intersection of adaptive algorithms and LLMs, highlighting the potential for developing personalized AI coaches and friends to further support mental health in a more adaptive and responsive manner."

      title: "Towards a Digital Self-Management Platform for People with Severe Mental Illness"
      speaker: "Prof. Emiel Krahmer"
      affiliation: "Tilburg University"
      abstract: "Many people with a severe mental illness, like depression or schizophrenia, have long episodes in which they are doing relatively well. The question arises how we can better support people during these periods, with the aim of preventing relapse, but without overburdening patients or care givers. For this purpose, we are currently developing (and plan to thoroughly evaluate) a platform for digital self-management that aims to help people with, for example, a history of depression to better monitor their own current well-being. The platform integrates an existing experience sampling method (a mobile app which asks participants repeatedly to briefly report on, for example, their thoughts, activities, and emotions on various moments during the day) and we will explore to what extent other sources of information can be integrated in this platform as well, such text, speech and video. This Dutch research project is part of a recently established Academic Collaborative Center for Digital Health & Mental Wellbeing at Tilburg University. In this center, researchers from a broad range of disciplines work together with societal partners on important and current challenges related to health and wellbeing."

      affiliation: "Stony Brook University"
      abstract: "Language-based assessments are promising for capturing diverse mental health diagnoses but need many words per person for accuracy. This talk introduces Adaptive Language-Based Assessment (ALBA), which adapts future prompts based on previous responses. ALBA iteratively selects the next best question to refine the estimate of an individual's psychological traits using limited responses. ALBA paves the way for conversational diagnostic agents, enabling dynamic scoring and personalized interactions. This approach improves diagnostic accuracy, reduces time for patients and clinicians, and enhances personalization in assessments."

      title: "Social Robots as Communication Partners to Support Emotional Health and Well-Being"
      speaker: "Dr. Guy Laban"
      affiliation: "University of Cambridge"
      abstract: "As society increasingly integrates artificial intelligence (AI) technologies designed for social interaction, understanding the communication dynamics between humans and social robots becomes essential. In this talk, I will present my research that explores the intersection of AI and human interpersonal communication. My studies focus on the dynamics of human-robot interaction, particularly how robots can foster meaningful social interactions that encourage users to express their emotions and feelings. In my research, I study how these interactions evolve over time, their potential for supporting emotional well-being, and their application in various settings such as caregiving and counselling. Through a series of experiments, my research uncovers the nuances of dialogue, self-disclosure, and emotion regulation in the context of social relationships with robots. The findings illuminate the varying degrees of emotional engagement exhibited towards robots, including how individuals adapt to and become comfortable with them over time, share their emotions, and experience positive effects in supporting their well-being."

      speaker: "Rémi Vaucher"
      affiliation: "University of Lyon 2"
      abstract: "Anomaly detection in multivariate signals is a task of paramount importance in many disciplines (epidemiology, finance, cognitive sciences and neurosciences, oncology, etc.). In this perspective, Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a battery of 'shape' invariants that can be exploited for the implementation of an effective detection scheme. Our work consists on the construction of simplicial complexes from the Signatures of signals and their predictive capacities, rather than the use of a generic distance. We explore in particular the detection of changes in topology, based on tracking the evolution of homological persistence and the Betti numbers associated with the complex. We apply our tools for the analysis of brain signals such as EEG to detect precursor phenomena to epileptic seizures."

      title: "Facial Prior Guided Micro-Expression Generation"
      speaker: "Yi Zhang"
      affiliation: "Peking University"
      abstract: "This talk focuses on the facial micro-expression (FME) generation task, which has potential application in enlarging digital FME datasets, thereby alleviating the lack of training data with labels in existing micro-expression datasets. FME generation remains challenging because existing generation methods can hardly encode subtle and short-term facial motion information. To this end, we present a facial-prior-guided FME generation framework that takes advantage of facial priors for facial motion generation. To achieve smooth and realistic synthesis results, we use our proposed facial prior module to guide motion representation and generation modules in mainstream image animation frameworks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed facial prior module can be adopted in image animation frameworks and significantly improve their performance on micro-expression generation. Moreover, we use the generation technique to enlarge existing datasets, thereby improving the performance of general action recognition backbones on the FME recognition task."

      speaker: "Dr. Weichen Wang"
      affiliation: "Meta/Dartmouth College"
      abstract: "Mobile phone sensing is increasingly being used in clinical research studies to assess a variety of mental health conditions (e.g., depression, psychosis). However, in-the-wild speech analysis -- beyond conversation detecting -- is a missing component of these mobile sensing platforms and studies. We augment an existing mobile sensing platform with a daily voice diary to assess and predict the severity of auditory verbal hallucinations (i.e., hearing sounds or voices in the absence of any speaker), a condition that affects people with and without psychiatric or neurological diagnoses. We collect 4809 audio diaries from N=384 subjects over a one-month-long study period. We investigate the performance of various deep-learning architectures using different combinations of sensor behavioral streams (e.g., voice, sleep, mobility, phone usage, etc.) and show the discriminative power of solely using audio recordings of speech as well as automatically generated transcripts of the recordings."

      speaker: "Prof. Joseph Hayes"
      affiliation: "UCL"
      abstract: "Severe mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychotic illness) is associated with considerable morbidity and premature mortality. Drug development for these conditions has slowed and a third of patients have a limited response to medication. The scale of the United Kingdom’s electronic health records facilitates large studies examining disease clustering, medication response prediction, adverse event tracking and symptom forecasting using machine learning approaches. Recent examples of this work from the aiMH Lab, Division of Psychiatry, UCL, will be discussed. These methods have the potential to improve physical and psychiatric outcomes in patients with severe mental illness."

      speaker: "Dr. Dominic Oliver"
      affiliation: "University of Oxford"
      abstract: "Detection of individuals at clinical high risk of psychosis is sub-optimal and inefficient, limiting the potential of effective primary indicated prevention. To address this, we previously developed, validated and implemented clinical prediction models using routinely collected electronic health record data for individuals at risk of psychosis in secondary mental health care. However, this model can only produce a single risk estimation at baseline, whereas individuals’ symptoms and substance use changes over time, and so does their psychosis risk. This talk will outline our past and ongoing implementation work as well as efforts to refine the model to dynamically update risk estimates as new information is entered into patients’ electronic health records."

      speaker: "Dr. Wenzhuo Zhou"
      affiliation: "University of California Irvine"
      abstract: "In recent years, graphs have become one of the most powerful abstractions for complex data, including brain networks, knowledge graphs, purchasing behavior, as well as disease pathways. Among many graph representation learning approaches, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising performance in a variety of graph-focused tasks. Despite their success, existing GNNs suffer from two significant limitations that hinder their broader applications in scientific discovery: a lack of interpretability in results due to their black-box nature, and an inability to learn representations of varying order information with statistical guarantees. In this talk, I will present a novel Actor-Critic Graph Neural Network (AC-GNN), which is able to integrate information of various orders under graph topology and provide interpretable results by identifying compact subgraph structures. Statistically, we establish the generalization error bound for AC-GNN via empirical Rademacher complexity, and showcase its power to represent layer-wise neighborhood mixing. Comprehensive numerical experiments using benchmark and synthetic datasets are conducted. Interestingly, we use AC-GNN to decode the behavior-oriented information from neuronal activity signals and confirm several important conjectures in neurobiology, thereby highlighting its effectiveness in advancing scientific research."

      speaker: "Dr. Isabel Berwian"
      affiliation: "Princeton University"
      abstract: "Psychotherapy aims to achieve change through learning. Early advances in psychotherapy, such as the development of exposure therapy, built on theoretical and experimental evidence from Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning. Now might be the right time to harness newer computational theories of learning such as reinforcement and structure learning and Bayesian inference to improve our understanding of mechanisms of change in psychotherapy and develop individual predictors of treatment response. I will start with introducing a computational perspective on change mechanisms in psychotherapy. Focusing on spontaneous recovery of fear after extinction as an example, I will illustrate how we can use computational modeling of such behavior to gain mechanistic insight and use this to simulate treatment effects and design clinical trials."

      affiliation: "King’s College London"
      abstract: "Individual participant data meta-analyses (IPDMA) have in recent years been applied to a range of mental health conditions to understand individual differences in treatment response and aid the personalisation of interventions. This presentation covers the results of a large-scale effort to collect and synthesise available data from randomised controlled trials studying the efficacy of psychological interventions versus control to prevent depressive relapse for people in remission from depression (see also: itfra.org). In this talk, I will further describe how individual participant data could be used to potentially improve risk stratification using decision tree analyses. Finally, I will reflect on the practical and methodological considerations of using IPDMA to aid the personalisation of interventions to individuals."

      speaker: "Daniela Teodorescu"
      affiliation: "LMU Munich"
      abstract: "Research in psychopathology has shown that, at an aggregate level, the patterns of emotional change over time—emotion dynamics—are indicators of one’s mental health. One’s patterns of emotion change have traditionally been determined through self-reports of emotions; however, there are known issues with accuracy, bias, and convenience. Recent approaches to determining emotion dynamics from one’s everyday utterances, addresses many of these concerns, but it is not yet known whether these measures of utterance emotion dynamics (UED) correlate with mental health diagnoses. Here, for the first time, we study the relationship between tweet emotion dynamics and mental health disorders. We find that each of the UED metrics studied varied by the user’s self-disclosed diagnosis. This work provides important early evidence for how linguistic cues pertaining to emotion dynamics can play a crucial role as biosocial markers for mental illnesses and aid in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of mental health disorders."

      speaker: "Kailai Yang"
      affiliation: "University of Manchester"
      abstract: "As an integral part of people’s daily lives, social media is becoming a rich source for automatic mental health analysis. As traditional discriminative methods bear poor generalization ability and low interpretability, the recent large language models (LLMs) have been explored for interpretable mental health analysis on social media, which aims to provide detailed explanations along with predictions in zero-shot or few-shot settings. The results show that LLMs still achieve unsatisfactory classification performance in a zero-shot/few-shot manner, which further significantly affects the quality of the generated explanations. Domain-specific finetuning is an effective solution, but faces two critical challenges: 1) lack of high-quality training data. 2) no open-source foundation LLMs. To alleviate these problems, we formally model interpretable mental health analysis as a text generation task, and build the first multi-task and multi-source interpretable mental health instruction (IMHI) dataset with 105K data samples to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. The raw social media data are collected from 10 existing sources covering 8 mental health analysis tasks. We prompt ChatGPT with expert-designed few-shot prompts to obtain explanations. To ensure the reliability of the explanations, we perform strict automatic and human evaluations on the correctness, consistency, and quality of generated data. Based on the IMHI dataset and LLaMA2 foundation models, we train MentaLLaMA, the first open-source instruction-following LLM series for interpretable mental health analysis on social media. We evaluate MentaLLaMA and other advanced methods on the IMHI benchmark, the first holistic evaluation benchmark for interpretable mental health analysis. The results show that MentaLLaMA approaches state-of-the-art discriminative methods in correctness and generates human-level explanations. MentaLLaMA models also show strong generalizability to unseen tasks."
