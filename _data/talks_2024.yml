      title: "Time Topological Analysis of EEG, a novel approach to unveil pre-critical behavior of epileptic seizure"
      speaker: "Rémi Vaucher"
      affiliation: "University of Lyon 2"
      abstract: "Anomaly detection in multivariate signals is a task of paramount importance in many disciplines (epidemiology, finance, cognitive sciences and neurosciences, oncology, etc.). In this perspective, Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a battery of 'shape' invariants that can be exploited for the implementation of an effective detection scheme. Our work consists on the construction of simplicial complexes from the Signatures of signals and their predictive capacities, rather than the use of a generic distance. We explore in particular the detection of changes in topology, based on tracking the evolution of homological persistence and the Betti numbers associated with the complex. We apply our tools for the analysis of brain signals such as EEG to detect precursor phenomena to epileptic seizures."

      title: "Facial Prior Guided Micro-Expression Generation"
      speaker: "Yi Zhang"
      affiliation: "Peking University"
      abstract: "This report focuses on the facial micro-expression (FME) generation task, which has potential application in enlarging digital FME datasets, thereby alleviating the lack of training data with labels in existing micro-expression datasets. FME generation remains challenging because existing generation methods can hardly encode subtle and short-term facial motion information. To this end, we present a facial-prior-guided FME generation framework that takes advantage of facial priors for facial motion generation. To achieve smooth and realistic synthesis results, we use our proposed facial prior module to guide motion representation and generation modules in mainstream image animation frameworks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed facial prior module can be adopted in image animation frameworks and significantly improve their performance on micro-expression generation. Moreover, we use the generation technique to enlarge existing datasets, thereby improving the performance of general action recognition backbones on the FME recognition task."

      title: "The Power of Speech in the Wild: Discriminative Power of Daily Voice Diaries in Understanding Auditory Verbal Hallucinations Using Deep Learning"
      speaker: "Dr. Weichen Wang"
      affiliation: "Meta/Dartmouth College"
      abstract: "Mobile phone sensing is increasingly being used in clinical research studies to assess a variety of mental health conditions (e.g., depression, psychosis). However, in-the-wild speech analysis -- beyond conversation detecting -- is a missing component of these mobile sensing platforms and studies. We augment an existing mobile sensing platform with a daily voice diary to assess and predict the severity of auditory verbal hallucinations (i.e., hearing sounds or voices in the absence of any speaker), a condition that affects people with and without psychiatric or neurological diagnoses. We collect 4809 audio diaries from N=384 subjects over a one-month-long study period. We investigate the performance of various deep-learning architectures using different combinations of sensor behavioral streams (e.g., voice, sleep, mobility, phone usage, etc.) and show the discriminative power of solely using audio recordings of speech as well as automatically generated transcripts of the recordings."

      title: "Applied informatics to improve outcomes in severe mental illness"
      speaker: "Prof. Joseph Hayes"
      affiliation: "UCL"
      abstract: "Severe mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychotic illness) is associated with considerable morbidity and premature mortality. Drug development for these conditions has slowed and a third of patients have a limited response to medication. The scale of the United Kingdom’s electronic health records facilitates large studies examining disease clustering, medication response prediction, adverse event tracking and symptom forecasting using machine learning approaches. Recent examples of this work from the aiMH Lab, Division of Psychiatry, UCL, will be discussed. These methods have the potential to improve physical and psychiatric outcomes in patients with severe mental illness."

      title: "Implementation and dynamic refinement of clinical prediction models to enhance psychosis prevention"
      speaker: "Dr. Dominic Oliver"
      affiliation: "University of Oxford"
      abstract: "Detection of individuals at clinical high risk of psychosis is sub-optimal and inefficient, limiting the potential of effective primary indicated prevention. To address this, we previously developed, validated and implemented clinical prediction models using routinely collected electronic health record data for individuals at risk of psychosis in secondary mental health care. However, this model can only produce a single risk estimation at baseline, whereas individuals’ symptoms and substance use changes over time, and so does their psychosis risk. This talk will outline our past and ongoing implementation work as well as efforts to refine the model to dynamically update risk estimates as new information is entered into patients’ electronic health records."

      title: "Actor-critic graph neural networks: A complete recipe for neural decoding"
      speaker: "Dr. Wenzhuo Zhou"
      affiliation: "University of California Irvine"
      abstract: "In recent years, graphs have become one of the most powerful abstractions for complex data, including brain networks, knowledge graphs, purchasing behavior, as well as disease pathways. Among many graph representation learning approaches, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising performance in a variety of graph-focused tasks. Despite their success, existing GNNs suffer from two significant limitations that hinder their broader applications in scientific discovery: a lack of interpretability in results due to their black-box nature, and an inability to learn representations of varying order information with statistical guarantees. In this talk, I will present a novel Actor-Critic Graph Neural Network (AC-GNN), which is able to integrate information of various orders under graph topology and provide interpretable results by identifying compact subgraph structures. Statistically, we establish the generalization error bound for AC-GNN via empirical Rademacher complexity, and showcase its power to represent layer-wise neighborhood mixing. Comprehensive numerical experiments using benchmark and synthetic datasets are conducted. Interestingly, we use AC-GNN to decode the behavior-oriented information from neuronal activity signals and confirm several important conjectures in neurobiology, thereby highlighting its effectiveness in advancing scientific research."

      title: "Computational models of learning to understand and improve change mechanisms in psychotherapy"
      speaker: "Dr. Isabel Berwian"
      affiliation: "Princeton University"
      abstract: "Psychotherapy aims to achieve change through learning. Early advances in psychotherapy, such as the development of exposure therapy, built on theoretical and experimental evidence from Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning. Now might be the right time to harness newer computational theories of learning such as reinforcement and structure learning and Bayesian inference to improve our understanding of mechanisms of change in psychotherapy and develop individual predictors of treatment response. I will start with introducing a computational perspective on change mechanisms in psychotherapy. Focusing on spontaneous recovery of fear after extinction as an example, I will illustrate how we can use computational modeling of such behavior to gain mechanistic insight and use this to simulate treatment effects and design clinical trials."

      title: "Preventing depressive relapse – what works for whom"
      speaker: "Dr. Josefien Breedvelt"
      affiliation: "King’s College London"
      abstract: "Individual participant data meta-analyses (IPDMA) have in recent years been applied to a range of mental health conditions to understand individual differences in treatment response and aid the personalisation of interventions. This presentation covers the results of a large-scale effort to collect and synthesise available data from randomised controlled trials studying the efficacy of psychological interventions versus control to prevent depressive relapse for people in remission from depression (see also: itfra.org). In this talk, I will further describe how individual participant data could be used to potentially improve risk stratification using decision tree analyses. Finally, I will reflect on the practical and methodological considerations of using IPDMA to aid the personalisation of interventions to individuals."

      title: "Language and mental health: measures of emotion dynamics from text as linguistic biosocial markers"
      speaker: "Daniela Teodorescu"
      affiliation: "LMU Munich"
      abstract: "Research in psychopathology has shown that, at an aggregate level, the patterns of emotional change over time—emotion dynamics—are indicators of one’s mental health. One’s patterns of emotion change have traditionally been determined through self-reports of emotions; however, there are known issues with accuracy, bias, and convenience. Recent approaches to determining emotion dynamics from one’s everyday utterances, addresses many of these concerns, but it is not yet known whether these measures of utterance emotion dynamics (UED) correlate with mental health diagnoses. Here, for the first time, we study the relationship between tweet emotion dynamics and mental health disorders. We find that each of the UED metrics studied varied by the user’s self-disclosed diagnosis. This work provides important early evidence for how linguistic cues pertaining to emotion dynamics can play a crucial role as biosocial markers for mental illnesses and aid in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of mental health disorders."

      title: "MentaLLaMA: Interpretable mental health analysis on social media with large language models"
      speaker: "Kailai Yang"
      affiliation: "University of Manchester"
      abstract: "As an integral part of people’s daily lives, social media is becoming a rich source for automatic mental health analysis. As traditional discriminative methods bear poor generalization ability and low interpretability, the recent large language models (LLMs) have been explored for interpretable mental health analysis on social media, which aims to provide detailed explanations along with predictions in zero-shot or few-shot settings. The results show that LLMs still achieve unsatisfactory classification performance in a zero-shot/few-shot manner, which further significantly affects the quality of the generated explanations. Domain-specific finetuning is an effective solution, but faces two critical challenges: 1) lack of high-quality training data. 2) no open-source foundation LLMs. To alleviate these problems, we formally model interpretable mental health analysis as a text generation task, and build the first multi-task and multi-source interpretable mental health instruction (IMHI) dataset with 105K data samples to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. The raw social media data are collected from 10 existing sources covering 8 mental health analysis tasks. We prompt ChatGPT with expert-designed few-shot prompts to obtain explanations. To ensure the reliability of the explanations, we perform strict automatic and human evaluations on the correctness, consistency, and quality of generated data. Based on the IMHI dataset and LLaMA2 foundation models, we train MentaLLaMA, the first open-source instruction-following LLM series for interpretable mental health analysis on social media. We evaluate MentaLLaMA and other advanced methods on the IMHI benchmark, the first holistic evaluation benchmark for interpretable mental health analysis. The results show that MentaLLaMA approaches state-of-the-art discriminative methods in correctness and generates human-level explanations. MentaLLaMA models also show strong generalizability to unseen tasks."
