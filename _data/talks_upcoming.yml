      title: "Computational models of learning to understand and improve change mechanisms in psychotherapy"
      speaker: "Dr. Isabel Berwian"
      affiliation: "Princeton University"
      abstract: "Psychotherapy aims to achieve change through learning. Early advances in psychotherapy, such as the development of exposure therapy, built on theoretical and experimental evidence from Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning. Now might be the right time to harness newer computational theories of learning such as reinforcement and structure learning and Bayesian inference to improve our understanding of mechanisms of change in psychotherapy and develop individual predictors of treatment response. I will start with introducing a computational perspective on change mechanisms in psychotherapy. Focusing on spontaneous recovery of fear after extinction as an example, I will illustrate how we can use computational modeling of such behavior to gain mechanistic insight and use this to simulate treatment effects and design clinical trials."

      title: "Preventing depressive relapse – what works for whom"
      speaker: "Dr. Josefien Breedvelt"
      affiliation: "King’s College London"
      abstract: "Individual participant data meta-analyses (IPDMA) have in recent years been applied to a range of mental health conditions to understand individual differences in treatment response and aid the personalisation of interventions. This presentation covers the results of a large-scale effort to collect and synthesise available data from randomised controlled trials studying the efficacy of psychological interventions versus control to prevent depressive relapse for people in remission from depression (see also: itfra.org). In this talk, I will further describe how individual participant data could be used to potentially improve risk stratification using decision tree analyses. Finally, I will reflect on the practical and methodological considerations of using IPDMA to aid the personalisation of interventions to individuals."
