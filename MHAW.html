	    <td>In the past, the notion of computational machines playing an important role in caring for people with mental health problems was hard to envisage. Today, this seems more realistic. Digital mental healthcare has entered into a defining period. How do we build ‘continuity of care’ into ‘disruptive direct-to-consumer’ technologies? How do we make life better for individuals not just easier? Government and industry-driven investments are raising expectations for improving outcomes, but at what cost? In this session, Dr Becky Inkster will navigate the audience through the emerging landscape of digital mental health. She will cover areas, including: (i) the latest emerging digital trends relevant to psychology and psychiatry, (ii) the ethical implications around data governance, quality of care, and equitable services, (iii) uncharted territories and future possibilities that we should start to envision now. Dr Inkster will also interleave a more holistic perspective on digital mental health by drawing from her related interests (e.g., financial health, space health etc.) as well as her background knowledge of neuroscience (genomics, molecular biology neuroimaging etc.), and experiences working with the arts and humanities. She will conclude her talk with a Q&A session, inviting any interested audience members to join her in developing ideas together.</td>

        <td>Characterizing dynamic communication in online eating disorder communities: a multiplex network approach</td>
        <td>Growing evidence shows that social media facilitate diffusion of both pro-recovery and anti-recovery information among people affected by mental health problems, while little is known about the associations of people’s activities in sharing different types of information. In this talk, we explore this question by analyzing a large set of Twitter conversations among users who self-identified as eating disordered. We use clustering algorithms to identify topics shared in online conversations and represent interpersonal interactions by a multilayer network in which each layer represents user-to-user communication on a different topic. By measuring structural properties of the multilayer network, we find that (i) the same set of users form social networks with different structures in communicating different types of information and (ii) exposure to content on body image can reinforce individual engagement in anti-recovery communication and weaken engagement in pro-recovery communication. By measuring structural changes in a sequence of temporal, multilayer networks built based on users’ conversations over time, we further find that (i) actors previously engaged in pro-recovery communication are likely to engage in anti-recovery communication in the future and (ii) actors in anti-recovery communication have frequent entries into and exits from such communication system. Our results shed light on the organization and evolution of communication in online eating disorder communities.</td>
