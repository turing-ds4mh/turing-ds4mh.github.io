## About Us

The vision for this interest group is to kick-start one or more projects using contemporary data science and multi-modal data for mental health to provide insight and benefit for individuals, clinicians, and contribute to fundamental research in mental health (including dementia) as well as the data science methodology. It aims to provide an informal bridge between clinicians, charities, and data owners (like CRIS, UKDP, and Biobank) and data science researchers to stimulate and align cutting edge research in this area.


## Meetings
We organise monthly meetings (including half-an-hour long invited talks) at the Turing. Meetings are organised and moderated by [Jenny Chim](https://j-chim.github.io/), [Yue Wu](https://datasig.ac.uk/people/yue-wu), and [Emilio Ferrucci](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/rossiferrucc/). 

Please [join our mailing list](https://forms.office.com/e/N0SaJbSnek) for more updated information.
