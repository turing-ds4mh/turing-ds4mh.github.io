# Data Science for Mental Health (DS4MH) @ The Alan Turing Institute


## About Us

The vision for this interest group is to kick-start one or more projects using contemporary data science and multi-modal data for mental health to provide insight and benefit for individuals, clinicians, and contribute to fundamental research in mental health (including dementia) as well as the data science methodology. It aims to provide an informal bridge between clinicians, charities, and data owners (like CRIS, UKDP, and Biobank) and data science researchers to stimulate and align cutting edge research in this area.


## Events
### Meetings
We organise monthly meetings (including half-an-hour long invited talks) at the Turing. Meetings are organised and moderated by Iqra Ali and [Yue Wu](https://datasig.ac.uk/people/yue-wu). Please [join our mailing list](https://forms.office.com/e/N0SaJbSnek) for more updated information.

As a part of AI UK Fringe, we jointly organised a hybrid event with the NLP interest group on [AI for Mental Health Monitoring](/aiuk2024.html) on 28th March 2024.

See [here](/meetings.html) for our previous talks.
